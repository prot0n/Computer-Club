Challenge Question: Week 5
===========================

## Stock Listing ##

The challenge is to generate a list of companies with their market cap in order, from biggest to smallest. You will only need to deal with stocks who have market caps in the billions (their market cap is suffixed with a 'B').

**Note:** The Hard Exercise is an introduction to this, you won't get any of this without it: https://github.com/pocon/Computer-Club/blob/master/Week%205/Exercises/3-Hard.md

### Details ###

A file called input.txt will contain one stock ticker per line (an example file is included at challenge_input.txt). You need to loop through these stocks. You then need to order them from largest to smallest based on market capitilisation (Market Cap - Basically, just a number if you don't know what it is: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization), and then output them in output.txt from largest to smallest, with a '-' between the ticker and the market cap. Make sure this is adhered to exactly.

### Example ###

#### input.txt ####

     GOOG
     YHOO
     FB
     AAPL


#### output.txt ####
     
     AAPL - 607.5B
     GOOG - 221.4B
     FB - 40.812B
     YHOO - 17.805B
     

### Scoring ###

To win, you must produce the shortest amount of code possible, to obtain the lowest score from the scorer (you can run the scorer, it's just a python script):

Submissions are due NLT 6:00 pm on Mon. Aug 27 2012 (srs - I have an exam the next morning so if it's too late, I won't be chucking it in at 12:00).
Make sure you place your name in a comment (put a # in front of it) on the first line of the program (this is how the leaderboard generates names)
