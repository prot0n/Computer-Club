t = True
f = False

# Operators that output booleans

print 6 > 4 # Greater Than - True
print 6 < 4 # Less Than - False
print 6 == 6 # Is Equal To (note: Double equal signs) - True
print 6 != 6 # Is Not Equal To - False
print 6 >= 6 # Is Greater Than or Equal to - True (as equal to)
print 4 <= 3 # Is Less Than or Equal To - False (as 4 > 3 and 4 != 3)
