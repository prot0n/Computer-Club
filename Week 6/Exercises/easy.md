Easy Exercise Week 6
======================

The RTA is logging all of the cars going over the bridge with e-tags and needs to store:

- E-Tag ID (a number)
- Number Plate
- Times Crossed

Write a simple class which allows this, called Car with the following:

- Car.numberplate: Numberplate
- Car.etag: ETag
- Car.crossed: Times Crossed
- Car.cross() : Function the RTA Calls when the car has crossed the bridge (has to increment Times Crossed)

Use initialisers to setup numberplate, etag and crossed at the beginning (crossed starts at 0)
