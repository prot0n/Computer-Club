What Needs To Be Done For the Scorer (write your name next to each when start doing and delete when done):
========================================================================================================

1. *DONE* Have scorer support ignoring comments -blakedut2
2. Have scorer support pulling name from first comment (idea is first line of code is # Name so we know who's it is)
3. Have Scorer Support removing raw_input (so it doesn't matter if I make a prompt say: "num:" or "Please Enter A Number:", they're the same)

4. Make Scorer into an object (Score) to which its initialiser is fed a filename and it sets the attributes score and name with the values pulled above
5. Create LeaderBoard Object which takes a directory as an initialiser, creates a list of all the Score objects it generates with all the files in the directory.
6. Create Function on leaderboard which generates markdown leaderboard and pushes to a specified filename

7. Create all the __main__ stuff to support if it's fed a directory or file and do whatever is correct accordingly (file = do single score and print the results, directory = Create Leaderboard and output to file).
