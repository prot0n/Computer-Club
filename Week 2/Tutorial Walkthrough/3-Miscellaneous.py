# Some Handy tips and tricks that you can use involving the basic code constructs

# The notation if variable_name : is exactly the same as if variable_name==True : This is useful in making your code cleaner, more efficient and less redundant

a=True
if a==True:
 print "Hi!"
if a:
 print "Hi!"

# You can put the block on the same line as the if statement if it's only one line. This is especially helpful in challenge questions where newlines are to be avoided at all costs. You can also do this with elif and else statements.

if 10>6: print "Hi!"

# is the same as...

if 10>6:
 print "Hi!"

# The print statement by itself inserts a new line

print

# The print statement auto-inserts a new line after printing something by default

a="Hi!"
print a

# Placing commas between strings passed to the print statement adds a space between them

a="My favourite TV show is"
print a,"Play School" # Disclaimer: Tutorials are for educational purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the personal views of the creator of this document.

# Placing a comma at the end has the useful effect of suppressing the new line

print "There shouldn't be a new line after this",
print "See?"

# The in statement

# In addition to use in "for x in y" loops, in can be used to check to see if a certain value is in a list, returning a Boolean as shown below

mylist1=[1,5,2,4,7,4,3]
if 5 in mylist1:
 print "5 is in the list!"
mylist1[1]=0
print (5 in mylist1)

# Some more advanced features of basic stuff. If you like, read through the python reference and links to other python tutorials to learn more features. This is only scratching the surface

# type() will return a special "type" object that represents the data type of the thing entered

print type(0) # int
print type("mystring") # string
print type([1,5,2]) # list

test="mystring"
print type(test)==type("cheese") # You can compare types, here both are strings so we get True

# append() and pop() remove or add objects from/to the end of a LIST
mylist=[1,2,3,4,5]
print mylist
mylist.append("cheese")
print mylist
print mylist.pop() # pop() will also return the object that it popped
print mylist
