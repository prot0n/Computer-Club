num1=float(raw_input("Enter the first number: "))
num2=float(raw_input("Enter the second number: "))
print num1/num2

#Note how this program doesn't check if num2 is 0, it'll throw an error if you enter 0. You might like to implement a modified program that checks for division by 0 and outputs a nicer error message
