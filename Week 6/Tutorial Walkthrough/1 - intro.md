Classes
=======

This week's tutorials are about classes and objects.

## So, what is an object? ##

An object is just a unit that holds data, and functions that work on the data.

For example, you can store a boat object, which might tell you the colour sails and the speed it's going at and have a function launch() which puts it on the water.

## What's a class ##

Simply, a class is what defines objects. An object is then just a variable that is created from a class. This will all become clearer later.



## Other ##

As objects/classes are complex in nature, it's probably best to read through something properly written before going on with the tutorials. Have a read over here: http://www.sthurlow.com/python/lesson08/

At least the first paragraph or so

## Real Use ##

As it may not be clear why you should use objects, have a look at the CompuClub Scorer where a score object is created for each submission, as well as an overall leaderboard object: https://github.com/pocon/Computer-Club/blob/master/Utilities/score.py
