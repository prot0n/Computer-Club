Week 6 Challenge Exercise
========================

*Note:* This is the Medium Week 4 Exercise but you'll have to think about making compact code.

## Talkin' 'Bout The Weather ##

A heatwave is a number of days where the temperature has been hot in a row (ie: above a threshold). A heatwave is a run of those hot days in a row, any temperature dropping below the threshold means that the heatwave is no longer running.

The challenge is to write a program which takes in a 'hot threshold' from the user (the temperature where, above it, the day is 'hot' - note: equalling this temperature is not 'hot') and then a whole bunch of temperatures (until the user leaves a blank line).

Then, all you have to do is print the longest heatwave that occurred

### Example ###

      Hot Threshold: 30
      Enter Temp: 20
      Enter Temp: 24
      Enter Temp: 31
      Enter Temp: 30
      Enter Temp: 31
      Enter Temp: 32
      Enter Temp: 29
      Enter Temp: 

      Longest Heatwave: 2



### Scoring ###

To win, you must produce the shortest amount of code possible, to obtain the lowest score from the scorer (you can run the scorer, it's just a python script):

### Submission ###

Submissions are due NLT 8:00 pm on Mon. September 10 2012.
Make sure you place your name in a comment (put a # in front of it) on the first line of the program (this is how the leaderboard generates names)

Email the submission to Patrick: me -at- padmel -dot- com


# Good Luck! #
