After learning about modules and files, urllib2 is a bit of a mixture between the two. Check it out here:

http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2

Basically, it allows you to read HTTP Data as you would a file, so you can treat websites as files, more or less.

Here's how it works... (after that, read through urllib2 to see what else you can do but much of it is like with files)

# Source Code Viewer:

import urllib2

page = urllib2.urlopen("http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2") # Specify the web address as the only argument, you can also provide POST data (if you don't know what this is, don't worry, it's not critical)

for line in page.readlines():
    print line


# Voila, you have yourself a Source Code Viewer. Isn't it cool you can interact with the web in the same way you can with local files?
