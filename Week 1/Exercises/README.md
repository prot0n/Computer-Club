Week 1 Exercises
=================
1. Write a program that prints "I like cheese."
2. Write a program that asks for the user to enter their name, and then prints it.
3. Write a program that asks the user for 2 integers and prints their sum.
4. The float() function is just like the int() method, except it returns a floating point variable (i.e. a decimal) rather than an integer. Using this, write a program that asks the user for 2 numbers and prints the value of the first divided by the second as a decimal.
5. Write a program that asks the user for an integer (say ab), calculates the value of ababab*ab, and prints a message stating this as your favourite number. For example, if I inputted "12" I should get 121212 * 12 = 1454544 and have printed "My favourite number is 1454544". 
6. Write a program that asks the user for a string and then prints the string in reverse. .sihT ekiL
7. Write a program that could be used to determine whether an entered integer is palindromic. Challenge: Don't use Booleans or conditionals. If you do this, describe how you would determine from your output whether it is palindromic.
8. Write a program that asks the user for a 5 letter string and then prints each character separately.

### Challenge ###

Write a program that checks whether an inputted number is a prime. It should print either "prime" or "composite" as an output. Entries will be ranked according to the "shortest" program (i.e. least number of characters) (see judging criteria below). Obviously your program needs to be working first.

Characters: Strings inside raw_input or input will not be counted. Whitespace of any kind (tabs or spaces) is not counted. Newlines incur a +3 penalty. All other characters incur a +1.
