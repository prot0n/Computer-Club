## Talkin' 'Bout The Weather ##

A heatwave is a number of days where the temperature has been hot in a row (ie: above a threshold). A heatwave is a run of those hot days in a row, any temperature dropping below the threshold means that the heatwave is no longer running.

The challenge is to write a program which takes in a 'hot threshold' from the user (the temperature where, above it, the day is 'hot' - note: equalling this temperature is not 'hot') and then a whole bunch of temperatures (until the user leaves a blank line).

Then, all you have to do is print the longest heatwave that occurred

### Example ###

      Hot Threshold: _30_
      Enter Temp: _20_
      Enter Temp: _24_
      Enter Temp: _31_
      Enter Temp: _30_
      Enter Temp: _31_
      Enter Temp: _32_
      Enter Temp: _29_
      Enter Temp: 

      Longest Heatwave: 2
