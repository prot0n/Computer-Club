Medium Exercise Week 6
======================

Some may remember that when Australia had a hung parliament back in the last election, there was a lot of confusion about whether Australia had a government yet and which party had the mandate to govern. It was a strange few weeks.

Luckily, there was a site which made it simple: doesaustraliahaveagovernmentyet.com

Which simply said "No" until we had a government, when it said "Yes".

## Task ##

Your task is to write a class (called government) which contains the variable "has_gov" which is just a boolean: True means we have a government, false means we do not.

Line 38 of the site is of interest to you as it says 

           <h1 id="yes">YES</h1> 
    
Note the whitespace. Consider it.

If the line is that, make gov True, else make has_gov false. It's that simple

**Hint:** 38 - 1 = 37

If you haven't read about urllib2 in Week 5's tutorials, you should read those before this.
