What makes it different is it can span multiple lines. It only stops being ignored after you insert three apostrophes again: '''



print 'Hello World' # Print simply writes something to the screen so you can read it. Note that Hello world is held in quotation marks, this makes it a string (ie: a word or phrase). It will not work if you type print HelloWorld as it tries to interpret HelloWorld as a variable (more on these later)
