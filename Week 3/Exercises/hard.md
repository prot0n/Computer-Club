Even More Difficult Problem
======================

## Word Distribution ##

Write a program to count the most frequently occuring words in a block of text. Prompt the user for text until they enter a blank line. Then display a chart of most frequently used words to least frequently used words.

      Type A Phrase: hey
      Type A Phrase: there
      Type A Phrase: hey bob
      Type A Phrase: 
      
      --> Word Distribution:
      2	  hey
      1	  bob
      1	  there

Order doesn't matter if they occur just as frequently (eg: Bob and there could be reversed in their order above). Nor does capitalisation (note: hey isn't different to Hey or HeY).
