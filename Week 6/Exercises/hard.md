Hard Exercise Week 6
======================

Teachers often complain about marking as much as we do about homework. Perhaps our python skills could help that process?

## Goal ##

To write a set of classes to take in test results

## Execution ##

Write:

1. A 'Boy' Class which stores boys
2. A 'Score' Class which stores a single boy's score
3. A 'Test' Class which keeps the scores
4. A 'Class' class to keep track of a whole class

Also provide class averages for tests, max scores, lowest scores, and allow a teacher to easily add in scores by a boy's "ID"
