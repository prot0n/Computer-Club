## FizzBuzz ##

### Intro ###
FizzBuzz is a classic programming question. Really, it's quite simple:

- Print out numbers sequentially each on a newline (eg: 1, 2, 3)
- If the number is divisible by 3: print 'fizz'
- If the number is divisible by 5: print 'buzz'
- If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5: print 'fizzbuzz'

Your program must take an input which asks to what number you want the game played to, and then it must print it out as above (see example below).

### Example ###

    Number Play To: _17_
    1
    2
    fizz
    4
    buzz
    fizz
    7
    8

    13
    14
    fizzbuzz
    16
    17


### Scoring ###

To win, you must produce the shortest amount of code possible, to obtain the lowest score from the scorer (you can run the scorer, it's just a python script):
