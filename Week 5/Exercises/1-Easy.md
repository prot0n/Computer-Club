Easy Exercise
==============

You've stumbled across a wild text file containing two columns of numbers, which are separated by a space. The challenge is to add up each row and return the sum:

### EG Input ###
    12 14
    13 10
    6  11

### EG Output ###
    26
    23
    17

And that's it!

## Hint ##

Check out the .split() function (ask around if you don't know what this is)
